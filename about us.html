    <p>Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.
Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point.

But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity.
